# micro_utilities

Python 3.6-3.7 scripts to deal with micro-SANS.
In detail:

- SLDcalculator.py calculates the density and SLD from the volume % of D2O
- getPeak_improved.py finds a peak and fits its neighborhood to overcome detector finite resolution
- surface.py takes a folder with several I(q) and clusters them to be plotted in Origin. It also shows the data in an interactive 3D graph
